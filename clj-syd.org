* =compojure= --- a Ring^{(TM)} compatible routing library

** =ring=

 - basic idea is to view an HTTP request as a function
   of an incoming map (the =request=) to an output map (the =response=)
 - these functions are called =handlers=
 - incoming requests are analyzed to choose a handler: this is the
   job of =compojure=


** Reloading Code

  [[file:src/my_compojure_app/handler.clj::#_%20(def%20server-stop-fn%20(http-server/run-server%20app%20{:port%209001}))][Demonstrate reloading here]]

 (notes - show that instead of reloading server, you can 
  just indirect the top route via the var.)


** middleware

 - a central idea behind this functional approach to handlers,
   requests and responses is the idea of a /middleware/; a function
   which sits "in the middle" between the request and your handler to
   modify the request map in some useful way before your handler gets
   to use it.

** toy example

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello, world!")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

(def app
  (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))

#+END_SRC

   
** This is all great, right?  /RIGHT?/


* Problems

** wrap-json

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  * you have a problem: non idempotent middlewares can be dangerous
  * don't do that: make sure you only call middleware once
  * now you have two problems

** categorizing middlewares

  * /before/  middlewares
  * /after/ middlewares

 Makes you think of Common Lisp's before/after methods...


** /before/  middlewares

  These want to run /before/ your handler to establish some
  sort of context on which your application depends

  - /e.g./ log (some part of) the request that your application is receiving
  - /e.g./ perform authentication


** /after/ middlewares

  These want to run /after/ your handler to perform some
  generic action common to every route in your application.

  - /e.g./ log (some part of) the response that your application is serving
  - /e.g./ transform the body of the response to JSON, if request had
    a header of =Accept: application/json=
